# VanillaCompressImages
Simple php scripts to compress images in uploads folder.
1. Upload both scripts to your public_html folder.
2. Configure the $startdir variable for the file path on your server.
3. When you run the <$yourdomainname>/compressimages.php script, images will be automatically compressed and the originals DELETED
4. If you want to optimise the images one by one manually, then visit <$yourdomainname>/compressimages.php?manual=1
5. Setup a cron job to run the php script as frequently as you would like.
